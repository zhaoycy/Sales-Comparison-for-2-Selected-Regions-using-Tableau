The dashboard was developed in Tableau and incorporated interactive Primary Region and Secondary Region parameters to allow users to dynamically select and compare any two regions from the dataset.

**Goal**: To create an interactive dashboard to visualise and compare sales performance between two dynamically selected regions.

**Description**: The project aimed to build a comparative sales performance dashboard for upper management to analyse and assess the differences between two selected regions. The goal was to provide data-driven insights for targeted improvements in regional sales strategy. The dashboard was developed in Tableau and incorporated interactive Primary Region and Secondary Region parameters to allow users to dynamically select and compare any two regions from the dataset. Calculated fields were created to capture First Order Date, Total Sales, Average Sales per Order, Number of Customers, Number of Orders, and Number of Products in Sale for each region. 

**Skills**: Hierarchy, Calculated fields, Parameters, filled map, text table.

**Results**: The final dashboard provided a dynamic, side-by-side view of regional sales performance, with drill-down capabilities for each key metric. The use of parameters allowed flexible comparisons between any two regions without manual filtering, significantly improving the decision-making process. By visualising sales KPIs such as first order date, average order value, and product diversity, stakeholders could identify patterns like delayed market entry or underperforming product mixes.
